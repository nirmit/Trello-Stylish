## Previewing changes
To preview locally built themes, do the following:
1. Go to your browser extension settings and allow Stylish / Stylus to view local files.
   1. Chrome: `chrome://extensions` -> Stylus "Details" -> "Allow access to file URLs"
   2. Firefox seems to have it by default
   3. Opera: ` opera://extensions` -> "Allow access to file URLs" under Stylus
2. Open the built file (`stylish.user.css`) in your browser (url: `file://path/to/stylish.user.css`). It should open a new Stylus tab.
3. On this tab, tick the "Live Reload" option, and then "Install Style". Make sure to remove the style installed from userstyles.org so that Stylus will use the built one.
